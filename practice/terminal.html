	<center><h1>Minimal Effort</h1></center>
	<center><p>	Hello! Welcome to Tips and Tricks for html where we will learn how to use vim in terminal. <br>The first this that you should know is how to open vim. To do this you should type, <br><kbd>vim insertfilename.here</kbd> <br>Once that is done we must make a minimal html page, it sould look something like this:</p></center>

	<code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>&lt;lang="en"&gt;<br>&lt;head&gt;<br>&lt;title&gt;Whatever you put here is the title of the webpage.&lt;/title&gt;<br>&lt;/head&gt;<br>&lt;body&gt;<br>&lt;p&gt;whatever you put here will be displayed on your website.&lt;/p&gt;<br>&lt;/body&gt;<br>&lt;/html&gt;</code>
	
	<center><p>This is what a minimal effort page looks like.<br>What you see inside the angle brakets are called tags, they allow for certian things. An example is:&lt;p&gt; this means paragraph and it allows you to write things that appear on you website as writing. However, When there is a open tag there also must be a closing tag or else everythig would be text. The closing tag will look like this: &lt;/p&gt;, it will always have a / after the &lt; sign.</p></center>

<center><h4>Attributes</h4></center>
<p>
An example of an attribute is &lt;lang="en"&gt;. Attributes tell your computer what to do about somthing or how they should do it. This one tells the computer that I am writing in english. Once you ar done writing your minimal html page hit<kbd> ESC</kbd> Then hit <kbd>:wq</kbd>. W saves your work and Q quits the file, if don't put w then you will quit without saving.
