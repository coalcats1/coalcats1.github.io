		<h1>Welcome to my recipe website</h1>
		<p>Hello, my name is Cole and these are TWO of my favorite
		<!--not really-->recipes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="1.html">Lasagna</a></li>
			<li><a href="2.html">Chicken Soup</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>I'm honestly not much of a cook but I do think it's worth
		giving these a try. I think these dishes are really what's
		going to make your day, they are amazing.
