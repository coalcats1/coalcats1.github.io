		<h3>Recap</h3>
		<p>When your using the internet the message your sending 
		gets split into equally sized packets. These packets can
		get lost, to prevent this the inter-net makes a incompleat
		map of all computers within reach of all computers within
		reach. These computers are identified with an ip adress.
		TO make sure your packets don't get lost the computer
		that recives the packets will respond and to tell your 
		computer it got them. Each packet has a nuber used to order
		it, like 1/27. Each packet will also contain a to and from
		so that they know where to send the acknowledgments. some 
		of the problems that required these solutions are: missing 
		packets, corrupted files, and no to or from.</p>
